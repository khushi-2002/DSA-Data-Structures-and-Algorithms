# **Lecture 5**


If conditions:  
When the condition is the deciding point of the operations, exactly as same as choices

* if and else: Only one will be exceute

syntax: 
>if (boolean expreession statements either T or F){  
    do something  
}     
else{  
    do this  
}

* If-elseif conditions:  
Multiple conditions can be checked and accordingly we can take decisions

syntax:     
>if(boolean expression either T or F){  
    do something  
}  
else if (boolean expression){  
    do something  
}  
else{  
    do something  
}


Loops:
1. while loop: When we don't know the no of times we need to run the loop

synatax:
> while(condition){  
    do something  
    increament  
}

2. Do-While loop: When we want to perform some task at least for once regardless thus use do while loops

> do{  
    do something  
    increment  
}while(condition);  

3. For loop: when we know, how many times we need to run our loop

> for(instialization, condition, increment/decrement){  
    do something  
}
